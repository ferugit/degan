# degan
Deep Effect Generation using GANs

Environment setup
First of all, install all dependences. Open a command line and run the next lines:

```bash
# create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
# activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Notice that data is tracked by DVC (Data Version Control) which has been used as a Python library. Thus, to download the dataset you must work with the virtual environment.
